# labtab

Labtab will be an application for Wizbots mentors for Android tablets and smartphones to be used for managing kids at the Robotics labs, tracking their progress and promoting them and also to shoot videos for each project completed by kids during a lab. 

The videos recorded should be uploaded when good internet connectivity is detected, since most of the times there is none at Schools and centers where the labs take place. Thus, an offline first approach must be used right from the start.
